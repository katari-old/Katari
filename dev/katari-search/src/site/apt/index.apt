Search design

 This module provides a site-wide, security aware, search facility with the help
 of compass, an indexing and search engine based on lucene that can be easily
 integrated with hibernate.

 The aim of this module is to provide final users a way to search for content
 across the whole application. Users enter a search condition and the module
 shows a list with the result of the search. Users can interact with each of the
 elements in the result, performing different actions. There is a default action
 (view), and modules can add additional actions.

 For example, if the client searches for a user name, the resulting list shows
 the name of the user, some details of the user, a link to show the full
 information of the user,  and a link allowing the client to modify the user.

How a search is performed

 The index module will find objects, but will not know how to handle them. It
 doesn't know anything about what it is being indexed, other modules provide the
 content. Each module must provide an adapter that wraps the result of the
 search in an object that holds all the information that the search module needs
 to present the result of the search on the screen.

 The full process is shown in the following diagram

[images/search-searching-sequence.png] How a search is performed

 The main entry point for the search process in the application layer is the
 SearchCommand. This command is created by spring and initialized by the spring
 controller with the query posted by the user. On the execute operation, the
 search command delegates all the work to the IndexRepository.

 The IndexRepository knows how to perform the search, with the help of compass.
 Once compass returns all the objects that matched the query, the
 IndexRepository finds, for each resulting object, the corresponding
 SearchAdapter instance. Those SearchAdapter instances are provided by the
 modules, and know how to create a SearchResultElement from the domain object
 found by compass. This SearchResultElement has all the information needed by
 the search module to show the result of the search.

 Finally, the IndexRepository returns to the command a SearchResult, that
 contains a list of SearchResultElement instances.

Security considerations

 The search module has implemented a simple security schema: it will only return
 to the user the elements of types that the user is allowed to view. To
 determine which elements the user is allowed to view, modules need to implement
 the getViewUrl operation in the SearchAdapter interface. This url must be
 independent of the specific object that will be viewed. The search module will
 use katari standard security mechanism (using acegi security) to check if the
 logged on user has access to that url.

Preparing a module to index its content

 A module that wants to integrate with the search module must provide two
 things:

 [[1]] A list of entities that must be indexed.

 [[1]] A list of adapters that adapt each entity to the requirements of the search
 module.

 []

 The indexed entities must be mapped by hibernate, and annotated with compass
 indexing annotations (for example, Searchable, SearchableId and
 SearchableProperty in the package org.compass.annotations).

 This is a fragment of an annotated entity:

-----
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
@Searchable
public class User {

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
  @Column(name = "id", nullable = false)
  @SearchableId
  private long id = 0;

  @Column(name = "name", nullable = false, length = 50)
  @SearchableProperty
  private String name;

  @Column(name = "email", nullable = false, length = 50)
  @SearchableProperty
  private String email;

  .
  .
  .
}
-----

 And this is a sample adapter for the previous object:

-----
public class UserSearchAdapter implements SearchAdapter {

  public SearchResultElement convert(final Object o, final float score) {

    User user = (User) o;

    ArrayList<Action> actions;
    actions = new ArrayList<Action>();

    actions.add(new Action("Edit", null,
          "userEdit.do?id=" + user.getId()));

    StringBuilder description = new StringBuilder();
    description.append("User - name: " + user.getName());
    description.append("; email: " + user.getEmail());

    return new SearchResultElement("User", user.getName(),
        description.toString(), "/module/user/user.do?id=" + user.getId(),
        actions, score);
  }

  public String getViewUrl() {
    return "/module/user/user.do";
  }

  public Class getAdaptedClass() {
    return User.class;
  }
}
-----

 As you can see, the adapter provides:

 * A view url, for the specific object, returned in the convert operation.

 * A description of the object, suitable to be show to the user.

 * A list of urls representing actions that the user can perform (for example,
 edit).

 * A generic view url. This is used to check if the user can access the type of
 object.

 * Which class this adapter adapts.

 []

 The last step to index the module content is to register the objects and the
 adapters in the search module. For that, add the following lines in your
 module.xml:

------
  <bean class='com.globant.katari.core.web.ListFactoryAppender'>
    <constructor-arg value='search.indexableClasses'/>
    <constructor-arg value='true'/>
    <constructor-arg>
      <list>
        <value>com.globant.katari.myModule.domain.User</value>
      </list>
    </constructor-arg>
  </bean>

  <bean class='com.globant.katari.core.web.ListFactoryAppender'>
    <constructor-arg value='search.adapters'/>
    <constructor-arg value='true'/>
    <constructor-arg>
      <list>
        <bean class="com.globant.katari.myModule.domain.UserSearchAdapter"/>
      </list>
    </constructor-arg>
  </bean>
------

 These two beans add the domain object (User) and its corresponding adapter
 (UserSearchAdapter) to the search.indexableClasses and search.adapters
 collections, defined in the search module. In this case, if the search module
 is not installed, nothing will happen. This is indicated by the 'true' value as
 the second constructor parameters in both beans.

Using this module

 To include this module in a Katari based application, simply put a line of the
 form:

------
<katari:import module="com.globant.katari.search"/>
------

 Importing module.xml will automatically index and search on all the entities
 provided by other modules that support indexing.

 This module also provides a weblet that can be used to show the search input
 text and its button. To use it, add the following to your decorator (usually
 header.dec):

------
<@katari.weblet "search" "search" />
------

Configuration

 The only configurable option provided by this module is the location of the
 lucene index. This is the default configuration:

-----
   <!-- Overridable bean to define the file system location to store the lucene
       index. -->
  <bean id='search.compassEngineConnection'
    class='com.globant.katari.core.spring.StringHolder'
    p:value='target/compass/' />
-----

 It is recommended to make this location configurable from the properties file.
 To do this, add to your applicationContext.xml:
 
-----
  <!-- Externalizes the location of the compass files for mirroring and search.
  -->
  <bean id='search.compassEngineConnection'
    class='com.globant.katari.core.spring.StringHolder'
    p:value-ref='indexLocation' />

  <!-- The value of this bean is intended to be overridden in the properties
       file. -->
  <bean id='indexLocation'
    class='com.globant.katari.core.spring.StringHolder'
    p:value='target/compass' />
-----

 This creates a bean adequate to be configured by a spring
 PropertyOverrideConfigurer. So you can add to your property file an entry like
 this:

-----
indexLocation=/home/tomcat/target/index
-----

 Compass can perform search and mirroring separately from batch indexing. The
 search.compassEngineConnection configuration defines the place where compass
 performs the search and mirroring operations. The
 search.compassIndexEngineConnection is used for batch indexing. Once the
 indexing process is finished, compass copies the new index to
 search.compassEngineConnection.

 The default location for the index operation is target/compass-tmp. As with
 compassEngineConnection, it is recommended to make this property configurable
 from the properties file:
 
-----
  <!-- Externalizes the location of the compass files for indexing. -->
  <bean id='search.compassIndexEngineConnection'
    class='com.globant.katari.core.spring.StringHolder'
    p:value-ref='indexTempLocation' />

  <!-- The value of this bean is intended to be overridden in the properties
       file. -->
  <bean id='indexTempLocation'
    class='com.globant.katari.core.spring.StringHolder'
    p:value='target/compass-temp' />
-----

The user interface

 The entry point of the search module is the previous weblet. This weblet shows
 an input field and a search button. When you click on the search button, you
 are taken to the search results page. This page contains the same input field
 and search button, plus a list with the result of the search.

 Each element of the list has a link to the 'view' location, and an optional
 list of actions.

Modules integrating search

 For now, the sample user module and the editable pages module index their
 content through this module. More to come ...

Next steps

 There are still a couple of things that would be nice to add here:

 * Integrate the highlighter.

 * Define a more fine grained security model, for example, define roles per
 object, an owner, etc.

 * Provide support to index things that are not hibernate mapped domain objects.

 * Improve the search result page.
