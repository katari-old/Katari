Katari - build and test tools

 This module contains build and test tools not needed at runtime.

 One notable feature is a mock smtp server. this is useful when your
 application sends emails and you need a very simple smtp server. To start it
 run:

-----
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.globant.katari.tools.MockSmtpServer
-----

 including this jar in the classpath.

 This server simply dumps all email received to the console output.
