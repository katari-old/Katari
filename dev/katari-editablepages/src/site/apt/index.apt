Editable pages design

 This module provides pages that can be edited by a user with the appropriate
 permissions.

 The main concept in this module is the page. A page belongs to a site. Pages
 have a name and a content. They can be referenced from other pages using
 [content-path]/module/editablepages/[page-name], or from other editable pages
 simply using the page name.

 The module has two modes: a user mode and an editor mode. The user mode is the
 standard way of navigating through the pages. The editor mode shows a toolbar
 where editors can edit, create, remove, modify, revert and publish pages.

 When an editor creates or modifies a page, the new content is only visible in
 editor mode. The editor must publish the page to be viewable by the general
 public.

 For editors, the module also provides a list of pages with their status. This
 is useful to identify 'dirty' pages (pages with modifications not yet
 published).

 There are two special roles relevant to this module: EDITOR and PUBLISHER.
 To create, edit or remove a page, a user must be have the EDITOR role. The
 PUBLISHER role is necessary to publish a page. Users with the ADMINISTRATOR
 role can perform both types of activities.

 If the search module is available, this module registers the pages to be
 indexed by the search module.

Using this module

 To include this module in a Katari based application, simply put a line of the
 form:

------
<import resource="classpath:/com/globant/katari/editablepages/module.xml"/>
------

 This module also provides a weblet that can be used to show editable page
 fragments. For this, use:

------
<@katari.weblet "editable-pages" "page" "[name]"/>
------

 where [name] is the name of the page you want to include.

Configuration

 There are two configuration options: the site name and the FCKEditor
 configuraition.

* Configuring the site name

 The site name under a collection of related pages can be stored. With this
 option you can have multiple sites on the same database under different tomcat
 instances.

 To set the site name, define a bean in your main application context (after the
 module import) like the following:

------
  <bean id="editable-pages.siteName"
    class="com.globant.katari.core.spring.StringHolder"
    p:value='mySite'/>
------

* Configuring FCKEditor

 Most of FCKEditor configuration option can be set in a javascript file that
 contains entries of the form:

------
FCKConfig.ImageUploadAllowedExtensions = ".(jpg|gif|jpeg|png)$" ;
------

 This javascript file must be accessible from the editor page. To configure the
 location of this javascript file you must define a bean
 in your application context like this:

------
  <bean id='editable-pages.fckEditorConfiguration'
    class='com.globant.katari.editablepages.view.FckEditorConfiguration'
    p:configurationUrl='/module/mymodule/asset/fckconfig.js'
    />
------

 You can customize other aspects of the editor setting the following properties
 in the previous spring bean:

------
  <bean id='editable-pages.fckEditorConfiguration'
    class='com.globant.katari.editablepages.view.FckEditorConfiguration'
    p:configurationUrl='/module/mymodule/asset/fckconfig.js'
    p:editorAreaCss='/module/decorator/css/fck-editorarea.css'
    p:toolbarSet='myToolbar'
    p:width='100%'
    p:height='500'/>
------

 [editorAreaCss:] The url for the css to style the content of the editor. This
 url must be relative to the context path. If you don't specify this parameter,
 the editor loads /module/decorator/css/fck-editorarea.css. Make sure to make
 this file available in that location if you do not change the editorAreaCss
 parameter.

 [configurationUrl:] The url (relative to the context path) for the fck config
 javascrip file. See the FckEditor documentation related to the configuration
 file (fckconfig.js).

 [toolbarSet:] The toolbar available to use in the editor. The possible toolbars
 are defined in the js file under configurationUrl. If that parameter is not
 defined, the only toolbar available is called EditablePagesMain.

 [height:] The height of the area containing the editor.

 [width:] The width of the area containing the editor.

 []

 See the javadoc for FckEditorConfiguration in the katari-editablepages module
 for more information on configuration options.

The user interface

 If a user has one of the relevant roles, the module automatically goes into
 editor mode. In this mode, each page is shown with a pencil icon in it's upper
 left corner. Clicking in this pencil shows the editor toolbar.

 As a future enhacements, we can provide an 'edit mode' button that shows the
 'pencil' menu and the yet to be published content.

Next steps

 The current integration with the search module shows the first 100 characters
 of the page content, including html tags. This should be revisited to extract
 only the text data from the html, and possibly integrate the compass
 highlighter.
