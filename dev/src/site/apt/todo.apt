 Some things to do, in preferred order of execution:

 * Add an password hashing mechanism.

 * Provide a way for 'extending' modules. A possible strategy: When
 the spring post-processor detects a bean named name.moduleExtension, it looks
 for the ModuleContext corresponding to the module 'name', and calls init with
 that module context.  It could be nice if the name of the bean is forced to be
 <name>.module. Now the .module suffix is optional.
 Another (or complementary) approach would be to declare a listener bean in the
 parent context that receives refresh events from the children contexts. This
 gives a bean in the parent context to apply a post-processor to the beans in
 the child contexts.

 * Freemarker: the view resolver should be configured in UTF-8:

----
<bean id="freemarkerViewResolver"
  class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.freemarker.FreeMarkerViewResolver">
  <property name="prefix" value="/"/>
  <property name="suffix" value=".ftl"/>
  <property name="order" value="1" />
  <property name="exposeSpringMacroHelpers" value="true"/>
  <property name="exposeRequestAttributes" value="true" />
  <property name="contentType" value="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
 </bean>
----

 Additionally, it will be nice to have a global configuration that overrides all
 FreeMarkerViewResolvers (macros, template paths, number format, etc).

 * See if it is better to use
 freemarker.template.TemplateDirectiveModel to implement the freemarker macros.

 * I18n.

 * Update mule to the latest version.

 * Add a configuration sample for hibernate second level cache, with focus on
 spring integration.

 * Add an error page. Note: if the app throws a 403 error, sitemesh does not
 decorates the error page. This is probably because the decorator filter is
 after the acegi filter. This can probably be solved implemnting
 ExceptionHandler and using a redirect (the default uses a forward).

 * Dirty html pages: confirm on close.

 * Provide a way to define the absolute cas, crud and web urls instead of
 depending on the client. Depending on the client is considered a security
 issue.

 * Revisit the 'ping test case'. Make the client use the SimplePageVerifier as:

 * Make the menu initialization more robust. Apparently it is possible to add
 child items to a leaf node.

 * Make the home module paint the logo as a weblet with a link to the home page.

 * Add some nice content to the home page.

 * Add a module to support web services with axis2 + spring (or something
 similar).

 * Add an inbox module, where other modules can register todo tasks to show to
 the user.

 * Add a scheduled tasks module.

 Some other cool stuff to play with:

 * ActiveMQ integration.

 * Integrate some workflow engine.

 * Auditory / clickstream ?????.
