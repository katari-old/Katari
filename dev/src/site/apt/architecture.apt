Architecture

 This chapter describes Katari general architecture.

* Modules

 Katari applications are designed with modularity in mind, so the main concept
 in Katari is a module. Each module is a reusable independent 'vertical cut' in
 the functionality, spanning from the UI down to persistence.

 We say that modules are contained in a Katari application, that serves as a
 module container. The module container provides common services to all
 modules, like request dispatching, menu registration, security infrastructure,
 and more.

 The full stack of each module (view, application and domain) can be
 independently packed in a jar and reused in many applications.

 The following figure gives a global overview of how a Katari application is
 structured.

[images/general-structure.png] High level module view

 Modules are plugged with the help of spring. There are three 'points of
 contact' between modules: the view, the domain and the database.

 [[1]] <<View>>

 At the view layer, the application consists of a servlet that dispatches the
 request to the corresponding module. This servlet listens to all requests that
 go to <context>/module. From there, the servlet dispatches the request to the
 corresponding module. The modules are mapped with the following url:
 <context>/module/<module-name>.

 For example, if the application is deployed at localhost:8098, the main module
 servlet gets all requests that go to:

----
 http://localhost:8098/acme-coyote/module.
----

 The user module gets mapped to the following url:

----
 http://localhost:8098/acme-coyote/module/user.
----

 The following figure describes how a request is dispatched to the destination
 servlet in a module, considering a request to
 <<<<http://localhost:8098/acme-coyote/module/user/editUser.do>>>>.

[images/module-dispatching.png] Module dispatching

 As you can see, the main entry point for a servlet request is the
 SpringBootstrapServlet. This is a servlet that simply passes the request to
 another servlet. The target server is configured in the spring application
 context, under a bean named, by default, 'katari.moduleContainer'. This bean
 is an instance of ModuleContainerServlet whose responsibility is to know all
 the modules registered in an application and dispatch the request to the
 corresponding module.

 [[1]] <<Domain>>

 Each module defines it's own domain model. We recommend following Evans
 recomendations layed out in Domain Driven Design. You will find entities,
 value objects, repositories, factories and services in modules implemented by
 us.

 All modules share the same classloader, so a module can use any public class
 from another module. With the help of spring, a module can export a service
 that can be used by any other module.

 [[1]] <<Database>>

 There is one database for all the modules. The database configuration is
 injected in every module through spring.

 []

* Module initialization

 When you write a module, you need to provide a spring bean that implements the
 Module interface. You usually use an instance of ConfigurableModule so you
 don't need to implement it yourself. The module interface defines:

 [[1]] An init lifecycle operation

-----
 void init(final com.globant.katari.core.web.ModuleContext context);
-----

 [[1]] A destroy lifecycle operation.

----
 void destroy();
----

 []

 When the spring application context starts up, a special Katari provided bean
 factory post-processor (ModuleBeanPostProcessor) takes care of initializing
 all the modules declared in the application context. This post-processor
 creates an instance of ModuleContext for each module and calls init. The
 ModuleContext is the point of contact between the module and its container. It
 allows the module to declare:

 [[1]] The module servlet and mappings (entry points).

 [[1]] The module web filter and mappings.

 [[1]] The module web context loader listeners and mappings.

 [[1]] The menu entries.

 [[1]] Security configuration.

 [[1]] The module weblets.

* Spring configuration

 As mentioned earlier, Katari uses spring as its DI framework. Katari makes
 heavy use of spring to split the application into modules. A normal Katari
 application has a main bean definition file usually called
 applicationContext.xml, located in the WEB-INF directory of the webapp. This
 file imports the module spring files, called module.xml (for example
 /com/globant/katari/editablepages/module.xml), and overrides some other beans
 to configure the modules (for example, the data source connection information.)

 A typical applicationContext.xml file looks like this:

----
<beans ... >
  <!-- The katari global beans. -->
  <import resource="classpath:/com/globant/katari/core/applicationContext.xml"/>

  <!-- The home module. -->
  <import resource="classpath:/com/globant/katari/sample/home/module.xml"/>

  <!-- The classic menu module. -->
  <import resource="classpath:/com/globant/katari/menu/classic/module.xml"/>

  .... more modules ....

  <!-- The hibernate properties, They are referenced from the hibernate bean. -->
  <bean id="katari.hibernateProperties"
    class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertiesFactoryBean">
    <property name="properties">
      <props>
        <prop key="hibernate.dialect">
          org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect
        </prop>
      </props>
    </property>
  </bean>

  <bean id="dataSource" class="com.mchange.v2.c3p0.ComboPooledDataSource"
    destroy-method="close">
    <property name="driverClass" value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"/>
    ... more datasource properties ....
  </bean>

  <!-- The katari data source as an alias to dataSource. -->
  <alias name="dataSource" alias="katari.dataSource"/>

  ... more configuration beans ...

</beans>
----

 A sample module.xml file is:

----
<beans ... >

  <bean id="editable-pages.module"
      class="com.globant.katari.core.web.ConfigurableModule">

    <property name='entryPoints'>
      <!-- The servlet mappings. It maps the spring DispatcherServlet to *.do.
      -->
      <bean
      ...
    </property>

  </bean

  <bean class='com.globant.katari.core.web.ListFactoryAppender'>
    <constructor-arg value='katari.persistentClasses'/>
    <constructor-arg>
      <list>
        <value>com.globant.katari.editablepages.domain.Page</value>
      </list>
    </constructor-arg>
  </bean>

  ... other beans ...

</beans>
----

 Given that beans defined in module.xml files share the same spring bean
 factory, every bean must comply to a strict naming convention:

 * Beans defined by katari start with "katari." prefix.

 * Beans defined by modules start with "<module>.".

 []

 This convention guarantees that beans do not accidentally override each other.

* Currently supported modules

 Katari includes the following modules:

 [katari-ajax] A module that exposes yui client-side widgets.

 [katari-classic-menu] Provides simple button menu bars.

 [katari-report] Allow users to upload and manage jasper reports.

 [katari-cas] Integrates CAS as a single sign-on for authentication with
 all the services within the application.

 [katari-local-login] Integrates the normal ACEGI login with a local
 database as means of authentication.

 []

 There are also a couple of sample modules that are included in the main web
 application:

 * The sytle module: provides a unified look and feel for all the modules in
 the application.

 * The user module: this is basically a user and role crud module.

 * The time reporting module: this is a sample module that serves as the core
 end user functionality in the basic example.

 []

* Layers

 Katari applications uses a traditional layered model, consisting of the
 following four layers:

 [View] It includes the servlet based front controllers (like
 spring-mvc controllers or struts actions) and the view templates (like
 freemarker templates).

 [Application] The application layer adapts the client requests performed
 through the view to the domain. This layer is responsible of converting the
 request data (usually strings or ids) to domain objects, delegate the request
 to the corresponding object in the domain and transaction demarcation. The
 Katari samples and modules use a command based approach in this layer.

 The view layer is permitted to call just one method per request en the
 application layer, plus additional idempotent methods when rendering the view.

 [Domain] Where the main business logic is implemented.

 [Persistence] The persistence layer consists of hibernate without any
 wrapping code. You should not see any package related to this layer in the
 project.

 []

[images/layers.png] The Katari layers

 The view and the application layer depends on the domain layer: classes from
 the domain layer can be imported in the view and/or application layers.

 Katari modules do not need to follow this layering schema, but it is our
 recomended approach.
